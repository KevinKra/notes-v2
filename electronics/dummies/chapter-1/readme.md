### Answers

#### Basics

#### Currents

#### Intro to Circuits

#### Supplying Electrical Energy

1. Electrical energy isn't created from scratch. An outside energy source is needed, ie converting another form of energy into electrical energy.
1. Mechanical, chemical, heat, or light energy, can be used to generate electricity.
1. Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC).
1. Direct current is a _steady_ flow of electrons in _one direction_ with very little variation in strength of the current.
1. Batteries most commonly produce DC current.
1. Alternating current is a fluctuating flow of electrons that changes directions (back and forth) periodically.
1. Power companies supply AC current to your outlets.
1. AC current electrons move back and forth whereas DC current is a steady flow of electrons that move in one direction.

#### Batteries

1. Batteries use a process called **Electrochemical reaction**.
1. Batteries use a process called Electrochemical reaction to generate voltage. This is done by creating a chemical barrier between two electrodes, where positive ions collect on one electrode and negative ions collect on another. The difference between the electrode's charge create voltage, or the force needed to push electrons around a circuit.
1. Charged atoms are called **ions**.
1. The metal plates that pool charged ions are called **electrodes**.
1. The difference in charge between the electrodes in a battery generates voltage when a closed circuit is administered.
1. Batteries use chemicals to prevent charged ions from coalescing.
1. The exposed part of a battery's electrode is called a **terminal**.
1. As the chemicals in a battery become depleted, fewer reactions take place, and the battery's voltage drops. Eventually the voltage, or current, is so weak that the battery can no longer generate electrical energy.
1. The electrons only move in one direction (from the negative terminal, through the circuit, to the positive terminal), because of this steady uni-directional current, the electric current generated from batteries is considered DC.
1. A battery, regardless of size, produces the same amount of electric current (~1.5volts).
1. The difference in size among batteries only influences the _amount of current_ (amps) that can be drawn from them.
1. Yes, larger batteries last longer.
1. Larger batteries are able to produce more "work". Work is the result of `power (watts) = voltage * current`. Since all batteries produce about ~1.5v, but larger batteries have stronger currents, the work or power of large batteries is great than that of smaller batteries.
1. An individual battery ins't really a battery, it's a **cell**. A battery is a _group of units working together_, one battery is a _cell_ (one of those units).
1. Connecting multiple cells together in a flashlight creates a **battery**.
1. A car battery is typically made up of _six_ cells, each generating ~2 volts of current, for a total of ~12 volts.

#### AC from a Power Plant

1. Electrical energy is considered a **secondary energy source** because it's generated through the conversion of a primary energy source (chemical, mechanical, nuclear, etc).
1. Electrical current generated from a power plant fluctuates, or changes direction, at a regular rate known as **frequency**.
1. The rate at which power changes direction, or fluctuates, is called frequency.
1. The frequency of current generate from power plants is **60Hz** in the US and (generally) **50Hz** in Europe.
1. Outlets generally provide 120 volts or (120 VAC), though some appliances, like clothes dryers, require 240 VAC and provided through a special outlet.
1. When traveling, you should bring a **power converter** to convert the AC from an outlet to the frequency used in your host country.
1. Tablets, computers, and other electronic devices require a steady DC supply. If you're using AC to supply an electronic device or circuit you'll need to convert AC to DC. **AC-to-DC adapters**, or AC adapters are used to do this.
1. AC adapters do not supply power, they convert AC into DC.
